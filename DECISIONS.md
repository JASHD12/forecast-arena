# DECISIONS.md - design decisions

One entry per decision a reviewer might question. Newest first.

## Decisions

## 2026-11-12 - Lock file format
Context: AGENTS.md 6 asks for dependencies pinned by a lock file. The first session ran in a
cloud sandbox where PyPI was not reachable, so `uv lock` could not resolve.
Decision: `requirements-lock.txt` with exact `==` pins of the packages already installed in
that sandbox. `make setup` installs from it with uv (if present) or pip.
Alternatives: `uv.lock` (preferred long term; regenerate once network is available and
switch `make setup` to `uv sync`); no lock (rejected: breaks reproducibility).

## 2026-11-12 - Runtime dependencies: pydantic and click
Context: SPEC 5 requires pydantic v2 models; SPEC/T015 needs a CLI with command groups.
Decision: `pydantic` for schemas, `click` for the CLI. Dev: `pytest`, `ruff`.
Alternatives: `argparse` (no nested groups without boilerplate), `typer` (adds a layer on
top of click for little gain).

## Proposals for the human

Ideas outside the specification. The agent lists them here and does not build them.
