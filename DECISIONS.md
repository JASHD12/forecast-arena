# DECISIONS.md - design decisions

One entry per decision a reviewer might question. Newest first.

Format:

## YYYY-MM-DD - Short title
Context: what forced a choice.
Decision: what was chosen.
Alternatives: what was rejected and why.

## Decisions

## 2026-11-12 - Run manifests are filed by the UTC start date of the run
Context: SPEC 6 names `runs/YYYY/MM/DD-<job>-<n>.json` without saying which date.
Decision: the UTC date the run started. Day X is sealed by the first resolve run of X+1,
which starts after every run of day X has finished (shared concurrency group), so a
manifest never lands in an already sealed day. `batch_date` is still recorded inside.
Alternatives: batch date (a late resolve run for an old batch would write into a sealed day).

## 2026-11-12 - Exact hash-chain formula
Context: SPEC 6 gives `sha256(prev_chain_sha256 + sorted "path:sha256" lines)`.
Decision: `sha256(prev + "\n" + "\n".join(sorted lines) + "\n")`, UTF-8; genesis prev is
64 zeros; days without files are sealed too so the chain has no gaps. Stated in
`arena/ledger/seal.py` and in METHODS.

## 2026-11-12 - Lock file format
Context: AGENTS.md 6 asks for dependencies pinned by a lock file. The first session ran in a
cloud sandbox where PyPI was not reachable, so `uv lock` could not resolve.
Decision: `requirements-lock.txt` with exact `==` pins of the packages already installed in
that sandbox. `make setup` installs from it with uv (if present) or pip.
Alternatives: `uv.lock` (preferred long term; regenerate once network is available and
switch `make setup` to `uv sync`); no lock (rejected: breaks reproducibility).
Made by: agent

## 2026-11-12 - Runtime dependencies: pydantic and click
Context: SPEC 5 requires pydantic v2 models; SPEC/T015 needs a CLI with command groups.
Decision: `pydantic` for schemas, `click` for the CLI. Dev: `pytest`, `ruff`.
Alternatives: `argparse` (no nested groups without boilerplate), `typer` (adds a layer on
top of click for little gain).

## Proposals for the human

Ideas outside the specification. The agent lists them here and does not build them.
